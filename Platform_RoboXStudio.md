# BAAI Embodied Intelligence All-in-One Platform (RoboXStudio)

The **BAAI Embodied Intelligence All-in-One Platform (RoboXStudio)** is a SaaS platform designed for **real-world data collection and management**.  
It supports data acquisition across diverse **robotic embodiments** and **teleoperation configurations**, covering the complete closed-loop toolchain from **task planning**, **data collection**, **data augmentation**, **data annotation**, **dataset management**, **model training**, **simulation evaluation**, to **model deployment**.  

RoboXStudio’s **training and inference module** is built upon the open and heterogeneous AI software stack **FlagOS**, providing a flexible and efficient environment for model development and execution.  
Leveraging **FlagOS**’s multi-chip adaptation, unified runtime framework, and distributed optimization capabilities, the platform enables high-performance model training and inference across diverse hardware architectures—greatly improving development efficiency and cross-platform portability for embodied intelligence models.  

Currently, the platform has successfully completed the **full training and inference workflow** based on **FlagOS + BAAI RoboBrain-X0 model**, achieving an end-to-end pipeline from model development and real-robot validation to task execution.  
This technical integration marks a significant milestone in applying general embodied intelligence models, laying a solid foundation for autonomous learning and multimodal interaction in robotics.
